module Orange::Middleware
  # The Orange::Middleware::Static middleware intercepts requests for static files
  # (javascript files, images, stylesheets, etc) based on the url prefixes
  # passed in the options, and serves them using a Rack::File object. 
  #
  # This differs from Rack::Static in that it can serve from multiple roots
  # to accommodate both Orange static files and site specific ones.
  # urls and root act the same as they do for Rack::Static. Only :libs option acts
  # specially.
  # 
  # Each lib is responsible for responding to static_url and static_dir
  # 
  # Examples:
  #           use Orange::Middleware::Static  :libs => [Orange::Core, AwesomeMod]
  #           use Orange::Middleware::Static  :libs => [Orange::Core, AwesomeMod],
  #                                           :urls => ["/favicon.ico"]
  #
  #         => Example 1 would load a file root for Orange::Core and Awesome Mod
  #             Orange::Core static_url is _orange_, and dir is the
  #             orange lib/assets folder
  #         => Example 2 would also redirect favicon.ico to the assets dir
  #
  # 
  # Note that as a general rule, Orange will assume everything static to be in an
  # /assets/ subfolder, therefore, '/assets' will be prepended to the url given
  # by static_url
  # Also note, that since this is the case - setting up a match for general '/assets'
  # could yield unpredictable results
  #
  # a static_url corresponds to the :module => in the add_css and add_js helpers
